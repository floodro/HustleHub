# Running the Application

This application was made using the Ionic framework, and The Ionic command line interface (CLI). In order for you to successfully run the application, you must install Ionic first on your computer. 

If you do this, there might be an issue where if you run the "ionic-serve" command, it will throw an error. So make sure to run the command below first so that it can run properly.

```
npm install
```

### Installation of the Ionic Framework and the Ionic CLI

Since we're running the application directly from Ionic, we must make sure that we already have Ionic itself setup.
```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [CLI documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).
